# Drawing Overlay

A simple drawing overlay for Wayland using SDL3. Tested with sway.

WIP

## Usage

run the executable, a transparent window will appear (fixed 1920x1080 for now.), draw on it.  
if the window is fullscreen it won't be transparent, looking into this.

only drawing on red for now, no color changing, scuffed undo/redo. features are coming soon(TM).
